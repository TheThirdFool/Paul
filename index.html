	Hello all. This is my website.<br/>	
	<br/>
	I am inspired by Ezra Koenig's blog INTERNET VIBES.	<br/>
	So I thought I'd do the same. <br/>
	<br/>
	<p>I am a PhD student who should be writing their thesis, instead I am doing this. I should say that I am jsut writing this in Vim on my laptop. So seplling mistakes are an integral part of the process. I hope you will show me grace.</p>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<h1>Post 1 - Writing a Thesis is GRIM!</h1>
<p>
I clearly hate writing my thesis. I know that you are supposed to hate it. But there is something so soul draining about typing out work you did two years ago. I can't wait to do the next thing!<br> 
But this is an attempt to distract myself from the horror of non-stop writing and to indulge the slightly interesting things that I find myself runnning into during this writing period:<br>
</p>

<h3>What motivates you?</h3>

<p> 
I had a slightly interesting conversation with JAMIE about the various types of motivation that can drive someone to do something. There are two main types: Intrinsic, and Extrinsic. The first is when the desire to do something comes from an internal source. i.e. I would like to solve a question because I would like to know the answer. Extrinsic, however, is when you are motived by external reward. i.e. I would like to solve a question because I would like a good score.<br>
<br>
I am definitley primarily governed by Intrinisic motivation - I can't bare to do something dull. This is playing out to be an issue with the PhD structure. I simply don't think it is possible to be excited about a project that you have worked on for the last 3.5 years (almost exactly!), it is just too well understood to be interesting. There is so much else I could be doing with my time!<br>
<br>
Our first deviation. When I started googling "Intrinsic Motivation" I was first shown a wikipedia article on intrinsic motivation as a mechanism in AI (perhaps that tells you something about me) by which the "agent" would exhibit curiosity and explortation. I was surprised by the obvious relationship between AI models and the psychology of motivation. It is an interesting thread. Perhaps if I wasn't spending all my time writing I would tug on it.

<h3>Coincidences throughout history</h3>
<p>
By coincindence I do not mean an unlikely similarity. I mean events, periods, people that overlap thoughout history in genuinely interesting ways.

I have heard a few examples of this listed before as fun facts. The two major ones were: Martin Luther King and Anne Frank were born in the same year, and that the end of the Mayan Empire overlapped with the beginning of the University of Oxford (although it seems the collapse of the classical Mayan empire had occured - way less cool without the mega cities). But here are some other interesting ones I found out about. I will update the list if I find any more:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first wagon in the oregon trail heads out the same year the fax machine is invented (1843) - The Fax machine is so old!</li>
<li>Mozart was alive for the entire American revolution (1756 - 1791).</li>
<li>The major one  - that Gandhi was in London for exactly the same period of time (1888 - 1891) as the "Jack the Ripper" murders were carried out... Some have extrapolated that his life of servitude can only be as a penance for his crimes in London.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help in the internet age</h3>

<p>
For some reason there is this new camera thing in Cambridge's market square. Apparently it is to reduce the anti-social behaviour that happens there. Seemingly, if you are feeling nervous you can hit the big red button and facetime the police. How that helps is not hugely clear to me. I haven't been back to double check recently but this camera is pointed at the "van of death" corner of the square. I hate to say it, but that's not where many people hang out after a boozy night. Perhaps the "van of life" side would be better?

<h3>The Spice Gauntlet</h3>

<img src="Images/SpiceGauntlet.jpg" alt="Spice gauntlet" width="150">
<p>
JAMIE and I have long discussed our various abilities in handling spice in it's various forms. When we met MICHAEL he quickly got on board and the spice gauntlet was first conceived. After a few months of not doing it, we decided we should try "doing it". The vast majority of the spices are from bottles etc. Save the Indian and Caribbean contributions - these I cooked myself. Potentially it was this freedom that allowed me to really juice up the caribbean one. This proved to be by far the spiciest and (my) favourite. With cinnamon, the scotch bonnet heat was a warm spice. Not just burning for the sake of burning.<br>
<br>
The two major discoveries made during the spice gauntlet are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PANKAJ makes a mean set of fried chicken wings. His hidden talent is astonishing.</li>
<li>Chicken wings hugely dampen the spice of hot sauce. The difference is astonishing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rating apples with GLEN</h3>
<p>
Cambridge apple festival went down in the Botanical gardens. GLEN and I went, shilled out a full Â£5 to check out the joint. Naturally we had to make a mess of the tasting tent. Below are our thoughts. GLEN was tempted to by a bag of the Red Fiesta "for posterity". The price put him off.<br>
<br>
After the apple festival we ultimately found our way to the Varisty Hotel rooftop bar where I finally convinced GLEN to join the hoards on instagram. This has proved to be an excellent play on my behalf as GLEN is pumping out quality content like his life depends on it.

<h3>Mobile editing</h3>
<p>
I have discovered that through the github app i am able to push edits to the website via direct editing of the html. Incredible! The future is mobile and soon I will code in my mind.
</p>

<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>
If I were to write an unhinged manifesto Kazinski style, I know what it would be railing against. Modern, awful, overhead lighting.
