Hello all.<br/>	
<br/>
This is a very simple website to post some of my hobby projects and thoughts. I am a PhD student who should be writing their thesis, instead I am doing this. I should say that I am just writing this in Vim on my laptop. So seplling mistakes are an integral part of the process.
