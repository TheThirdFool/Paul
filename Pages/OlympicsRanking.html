<h1>Olympics ranking</h1>
<p>
It is that time of the Olympic cycle that I start thinking a lot about the ranking systems used to evaluate the performances of various countries. The international standard is to rank countries by the number of gold medals they win, with ties being broken by the number of silvers, and in the rare instance of further ties, bronzes. This method is accepted as universally as the metric system. That is to say it is rejected by the US.<br>
<br>
The consensus in America is to use the total number of medals to rank contries, with no regard for the colour of the metal. It is my suspicion that this is because it reliably places the US at the top of the rankings, as, while China will occasionally win more golds, the Americans' total medal haul will almost always dwarf the competition. The last time America did not win the most gold medals was 2008 in Bejing, but American media confidentally claimed victory due to a a higher tally of total medals.<br>
<br>
To me this raises an interesting question: What defines a good performance at the olympics? For each athlete, the national medal count will be a distant afterthought as they pursue individual greatness. Gold is the primary goal, but to medal at all is a huge acheivement and rightly those medals will be cherished. However, to weight the gold medal the same as the silver in the medal count seems ridiculous to me. In sports there is a clearly defined winner and this should be reflected in the country ranking. If it isn't then why not give points for 4th place, or 5th, 6th, and it goes on. Points for participation doesn't reward greatness in a satisfying way. However, medals are awarded for 2nd and 3rd. Athletes strive for these and celebrate when they are hung around their necks. Sometimes the battle for bronze is brutal and competitive to the end, this is almost certainly becuase we reward those who prevail with a chunk of metal. This too should be reflected in the rankings.<br>
<br>
The final compenent in a country's olympic performance is their return. Wonderfully illustrated by the difference between the dingy carrying the Algerian Olympic team and the cruise liner shipping the USA athletes, different countries enter different numbers of athletes. The US is almost guarenteed to bring home the most medals because they enter the most events. I believe that 'hit rate' of a country shoudl be reflected in their score.<br>
<br>
As a result let me present my methodology:<br>
<br>
$${S = \frac{(5 \times G)\ +\ (3 \times S)\ +\ B}{N_{Athletes}}}$$<br>
<br>
This weights the gold, silver, and bronze medals while correcting for the number of athletes entered by a country. Here are the results:
</p>
<pre>
<ol>
<li> St Lucia      - 2.000  [1G, 1S, 0B, 4 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Dominica      - 1.250  [1G, 0S, 0B, 4 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Bahrain       - 1.000  [2G, 1S, 1B, 14 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Iran          - 0.923  [3G, 6S, 3B, 39 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Georgia       - 0.893  [3G, 3S, 1B, 28 Atheletes] </li>
<li> China         - 0.786  [40G, 27S, 24B, 388 Atheletes] </li>
<li> South Korea   - 0.723  [13G, 9S, 10B, 141 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Pakistan      - 0.714  [1G, 0S, 0B, 7 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Armenia       - 0.667  [0G, 3S, 1B, 15 Atheletes] </li>
<li> United States - 0.630  [40G, 44S, 42B, 594 Atheletes] </li>
<li> North Korea   - 0.625  [0G, 2S, 4B, 16 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Kyrgyzstan    - 0.625  [0G, 2S, 4B, 16 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Botswana      - 0.615  [1G, 1S, 0B, 13 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Uzbekistan    - 0.570  [8G, 2S, 3B, 86 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Philippines   - 0.545  [2G, 0S, 2B, 22 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Great Britain - 0.505  [14G, 22S, 29B, 327 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Bulgaria      - 0.457  [3G, 1S, 3B, 46 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Kosovo        - 0.444  [0G, 1S, 1B, 9 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Kenya         - 0.443  [4G, 2S, 5B, 70 Atheletes] </li>
<li> Ethiopia      - 0.438  [1G, 3S, 0B, 32 Atheletes] </li>
</ol>
</pre>
<p>
Interesting results no? St Lucia is the big winner with two medals for 4 athletes - a great return! The US has also done well, but fallen below China, South Korea, and several of the small contries that were able to medal.<br>
<br>
I should note that this method is not fully refined yet. At the moment participating in a team game is hugely detrimental to your score. If you get gold with a 12 athlete team, you have 0.4 points, dramatically less than the 5 points a single golden athlete would be awarded. Additionally, superstars like Simone Biles and Leon Marchand who win multiple medals across several events are contributing too many points and each race / entry should be considered as seperate. However, as a first order ranking, this highlights different countries and stories in a satisfying way. The success of North Korea in the first olympics after they declined to participate in 2020 is fascinating, and the images of North and South Koreans posing for photos together on the podium may be reflected on as a significant moment in olympics history.<br>
