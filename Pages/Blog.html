<h1>Post 1 - Writing a Thesis is GRIM!</h1>
<p>
I clearly hate writing my thesis. I know that you are supposed to hate it. But there is something so soul draining about typing out work you did two years ago. I can't wait to do the next thing!<br> 
But this is an attempt to distract myself from the horror of non-stop writing and to indulge the slightly interesting things that I find myself runnning into during this writing period:<br>
</p>

<h3>What motivates you?</h3>

<p> 
I had a slightly interesting conversation with JAMIE about the various types of motivation that can drive someone to do something. There are two main types: Intrinsic, and Extrinsic. The first is when the desire to do something comes from an internal source. i.e. I would like to solve a question because I would like to know the answer. Extrinsic, however, is when you are motived by external reward. i.e. I would like to solve a question because I would like a good score.<br>
<br>
I am definitley primarily governed by Intrinisic motivation - I can't bare to do something dull. This is playing out to be an issue with the PhD structure. I simply don't think it is possible to be excited about a project that you have worked on for the last 3.5 years (almost exactly!), it is just too well understood to be interesting. There is so much else I could be doing with my time!<br>
<br>
Our first deviation. When I started googling "Intrinsic Motivation" I was first shown a wikipedia article on intrinsic motivation as a mechanism in AI (perhaps that tells you something about me) by which the "agent" would exhibit curiosity and explortation. I was surprised by the obvious relationship between AI models and the psychology of motivation. It is an interesting thread. Perhaps if I wasn't spending all my time writing I would tug on it.

<h3>Coincidences throughout history</h3>
<p>
By coincindence I do not mean an unlikely similarity. I mean events, periods, people that overlap thoughout history in genuinely interesting ways.

I have heard a few examples of this listed before as fun facts. The two major ones were: Martin Luther King and Anne Frank were born in the same year, and that the end of the Mayan Empire overlapped with the beginning of the University of Oxford (although it seems the collapse of the classical Mayan empire had occured - way less cool without the mega cities). But here are some other interesting ones I found out about. I will update the list if I find any more:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The first wagon in the oregon trail heads out the same year the fax machine is invented (1843) - The Fax machine is so old!</li>
<li>Mozart was alive for the entire American revolution (1756 - 1791).</li>
<li>The major one  - that Gandhi was in London for exactly the same period of time (1888 - 1891) as the "Jack the Ripper" murders were carried out... Some have extrapolated that his life of servitude can only be as a penance for his crimes in London.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Help in the internet age</h3>

For some reason there is this new camera thing in Cambridge's market square. Apparently it is to reduce the anti-social behaviour that happens there. Seemingly, if you are feeling nervous you can hit the big red button and facetime the police. How that helps is not hugely clear to me. I haven't been back to double check recently but this camera is pointed at the "van of death" corner of the square. I hate to say it, but that's not where many people hang out after a boozy night. Perhaps the "van of life" side would be better?

<h3>The Spice Gauntlet</h3>

<img src="../Images/SpiceGauntlet.jpg" alt="Spice gauntlet" width="150">
<p>
JAMIE and I have long discussed our various abilities in handling spice in it's various forms. When we met MICHAEL he quickly got on board and the spice gauntlet was first conceived. After a few months of not doing it, we decided we should try "doing it". The vast majority of the spices are from bottles etc. Save the Indian and Caribbean contributions - these I cooked myself. Potentially it was this freedom that allowed me to really juice up the caribbean one. This proved to be by far the spiciest and (my) favourite. With cinnamon, the scotch bonnet heat was a warm spice. Not just burning for the sake of burning.<br>
<br>
The two major discoveries made during the spice gauntlet are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PANKAJ makes a mean set of fried chicken wings. His hidden talent is astonishing.</li>
<li>Chicken wings hugely dampen the spice of hot sauce. The difference is astonishing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rating apples with GLEN</h3>
<p>
Cambridge apple festival went down in the Botanical gardens. GLEN and I went, shilled out a full Â£5 to check out the joint. Naturally we had to make a mess of the tasting tent. Below are our thoughts. GLEN was tempted to by a bag of the Red Fiesta "for posterity". The price put him off.<br>
<br>
After the apple festival we ultimately found our way to the Varisty Hotel rooftop bar where I finally convinced GLEN to join the hoards on instagram. This has proved to be an excellent play on my behalf as GLEN is pumping out quality content like his life depends on it.

<h3>Mobile editing</h3>
<p>
I have discovered that through the github app i am able to push edits to the website via direct editing of the html. Incredible! The future is mobile and soon I will code in my mind.

<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>
If I were to write an unhinged manifesto Kaczynski style, I know what it would be railing against. Modern, awful, overhead lighting.<br>
<br>
In 2023 a disgruntled cleaner narced on my flat for having candles in our living room. As college property, this was ostensibly not permitted. But as those who have ever lived in ugly buildings know, a candle-lit dinner can sometimes be the only escape. We were told that under no circumstances could we continue to own the candles - for fear we would burn down the building. I remember a "Grade I" being thrown into the mix - NOT an accusation you could levy at Cosin Court. This vague anxiety was not only patently ridiculous, but also profoundly inconsistent as just across the street is a geniunely Grade I listed building which is full of candles every night - the Peterhouse Hall. I was particularly miffed as just weeks before, a fire had broken out in the Fellow's Combination room when a laurel wreath had ignited after a candle had been left unattended. But the Fellows - who had demonstrated themselves as not to be trusted with candles were in the next night living it up with the naked flame. I do not even particularly bemoan the fellows, as I have always been inspired by the choice of the Peterhouse fellowship to reject the wheels of change. As when Lord Kelvin installed electric lights in the Hall, only the Second building in the UK to have electric lights installed. Peterhouse stood alone as the first true bastion of authentic lighting by being the first building to UNINSTALL electric lights. A brave move I wish more poeple would take.<br>
<br>
In a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.02.001">paper</a> on the impact of lighting temperature on productivity and mood, the authors conclude that <i>"The effect of </i>colour temperature<i> on mood was most robust and demonstrated more positive affect and less negative affect in warmer lighting."</i> i.e. Warmer lighting improves mood. Coincidentally, the same paper claims that cooler lighting does not impact productivity much at all (although this is definitely not consensus). This is to say that it is consistently found in the literature that warm lighting helps with mood and social interactions. The candle is an obvious candidate, but I would extend this to all warm floor lighting options. The single unailaibale truth is that the big light is NOT A VIBE. I have never been at a party and thought "if only someone turned on that huge bright white light hanging from the ceiling". I have included my lighting vibes visualised to give context. My final word is that you can always turn off the lights. In my current house I can cover the movement sensor with a sock and bring a lamp from my room. Good lighting is always within reach, and thus vibes are under control.

<h3>A newfound fixation on aesthetic</h3>
<p>
Earlier this month I fished my dad's old film camera out of a dusty corner of our downstairs cupboard. I have always been interested in the vintage look of film and attempted to emulate this when taking digital photos. But I have never been able to get that ephemeral quality I am looking for.<br>
<br>
It isn't obvious why film photos look different to digital ones, and why they evoke such different emotions. The subjects are the same, the lenses are the same, the only difference is the sensor that collects the light. Given my PhD title, this piques my interest. The main difference between formats is that of the pixels themselves. Photographic film is composed of millions of microscopic silver halide crystals suspended in gelatine. Photons hit these crystals, liberate electrons that collect in defects where they combine with silver ions to form a speck of silver. If there is enough silver in a defect, the entire crystal can be converted to metalic silver during development and will show up in the negative. In essence, the silver crystals are the pixels in film. Unlike the pixles on a digital camera's CCD, the crystals are A. absolutely tiny and B. irregular in both size and position. This means that film is able to have a comprable resolution to digital cameras (at least for the film I am using / some are much higher), and that the pixels are not in a grid. Odd shapes in odd orientations. This is the origin of the film grain that is so characteristic of iconic film photos. Perhaps this is the feature that digital is missing. Adding film grain in post just doesn't hit in the same way.<br>
<br>
When snooping around photography blogs and other hot takes on the internet, you will see this film-digital divide explained with either a wide range of technical reasons as I have tried to above, or a misty eyed description of film's realness. I think that universally everyone appreciates film's ability to capture the moment, imperfections and all. Grainy, blurry shots that, for some as of yet unsettled reason, feel like a true moment in time. Given my life has slowed down to contain far fewer moments, I figured that now was as good a time as any to try the real thing. The stakes are low, as there is nothing to miss.<br>
<br>
I took a roll of photos and several weeks later got the scans back. It was incredible. Not the photos - they were mainly bad. I have no idea how to use the camera and was struggling to take anything even in the same postcode as being correctly exposed. But, the more I look at them, the more impressed I am with their ability to transport me to the moment. It really is the imperfections - this sense that these photos could be in my parents photo album from 1986 and not look out of place. I have posted them on my instagram and to me it is a glaring aestheic transition from my previous photos taken with a digital camera. The perfectly crisp, perfectly exposed, and meticulously edited photos suddenly feel wrong. Almost insincere. I have started to question my whole aesthetic. Am I successfully emulating the casual effortless preppy coolness that you see in Vampire Weekend album covers, or photos of actors in their bohemian youth. I fear I am not suffiently committed enough to the detached aestheic attitude I so admire. <i>Posting photos not because they look good but becasue they were the only photos you have.</i> Perhaps film is my route to truly acheiving this standard? I will report back when I have more moments to capture.
